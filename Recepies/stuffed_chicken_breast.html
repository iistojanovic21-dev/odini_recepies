    <p><strong>This Stuffed Chicken Breast has a creamy 3-cheese blend with spinach, herbs, and sun-dried tomatoes! It's easy to make and customize with different fillings!</strong></p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Salt and peppe</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <strong>Filling</strong>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cups packed spinach, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes, drained/chopped</li>
        <li>4 oz. cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella</li>
        <li>1/3 cup Parmesan, grated</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon EACH: dried basil, dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <strong>Prepare the Filling</strong>

        <li>Preheat oven to 375° F.</li>
        <li>Add 1-2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the spinach and garlic and cook until wilted, 3-4 minutes. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Set the spinach/garlic and sundried tomatoes aside. Combine remaining filling ingredients, then gently stir in the spinach/garlic and tomatoes. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <strong>Prepare the Chicken</strong>

        <li>Pat the chicken dry. Use a sharp paring knife to create a pocket for the stuffing. (Slice the side of the chicken that has the fold on the bottom.) Be careful not to cut all the way through to the other side. (See process shots in blog post for a visual on what the pocket area looks like.)</li>
        <li>Stuff each chicken breast with the filling. Sprinkle the top of the chicken with salt, pepper, and paprika.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is glistening and hot, add 2 chicken breasts at a time and sear each side until it begins to turn golden, 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pro Tip: I use 2 spatulas to maneuver the chicken when flipping, it’s easier to handle gently. The top and bottom of chicken will cook about halfway up but the middle will still be uncooked.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <strong>Bake</strong>

        <li>If your skillet is not oven safe, transfer the chicken to a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake uncovered at 375° for 17-20 minutes, or until the thickest part of the chicken reaches 165°.</li>
    </ol>
