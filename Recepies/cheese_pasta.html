    <p><strong>This Cheese Pasta recipe has savory pasta smothered in the most delicious broccoli cheese sauce! This 30-minute recipe makes a great side dish or meatless meal.</strong></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <strong>Sauce</strong>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup half and half</li>
        <li>½ chicken bouillon cube</li>
        <li>1 tsp hot sauce</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon EACH: onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil, mustard powder, parsley</li>
    </ul>    

    <ul>
        <strong>Pasta</strong>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups broccoli</li>
        <li>½ lb. Gemelli pasta</li>
        <li>1 cup cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Note: Ensure the broccoli is very finely chopped for this recipe to ensure it cooks through.</li>
        <li>Combine the chicken broth, half and half, 1/2 bouillon cube, hot sauce, and seasonings in a large measuring cup with a spout and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients before beginning.</li>
        <li>Begin boiling water for the pasta. Once a boil is reached, salt the water. (I use 1/2 tbsp. kosher salt.)</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large, high-walled skillet over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth mixture from step 1 in small splashes, stirring continuously. Add the broccoli. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Cover partially while you boil the pasta to al dente. Gently stir the pasta periodically throughout cooking. Drain once cooked.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat of the sauce to low and stir in the cheese until combined.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta and stir to combine. It will continue to thicken and absorb the sauce upon standing. Serve!</li>
    </ol>
